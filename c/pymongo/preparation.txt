1. Start the mongod with authorization.

  Add the following block to /etc/mongod.conf and restart mongod.

  ~~~
  security:
    authorization: enabled
  ~~~

2. Register the first superuser to the database.

  Type the following commands:

  ~~~
  $ mongo
  > use admin
  switched to db admin
  > db.createUser({user:"mongo", pwd:"mongo", roles:["root"]})
  Successfully added user: { "user" : "mongo", "roles" : [ "root" ] }
  ~~~

  The registered user "mongo" can be used only in the database "admin"
  because the user "admin" registered only to this database.

3. Login as the registered superuser "mongo".

  Type the following command and password:

  ~~~
  $ mongo -u mongo
  MongoDB shell version v4.2.8
  Enter password: 
  ~~~

  or

  ~~~
  $ mongo
  > use admin
  switched to db admin
  > db.auth("mongo", "mongo")
  1
  ~~~

4. Create new database and add its owner.

  ~~~
  $ mongo -u mongo
  > use mydb
  switched to db mydb
  > db.createUser({user:"mydb", pwd:"mydb", roles:["dbOwner"]})
  Successfully added user: { "user" : "mydb", "roles" : [ "dbOwner" ] }
  ~~~

  for more roles, see:
    https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/built-in-roles/

5. Add an user given the role "readWrite" to the database "mydb".

  ~~~
  $ mongo -u mydb mydb
  > db.createUser({user:"mydbuser", pwd:"mydbuser", roles:["readWrite"]})
  Successfully added user: { "user" : "mydbuser", "roles" : [ "readWrite" ] }
  ~~~
